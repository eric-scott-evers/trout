 set_tool:is_subset(nat, real) 
   [nat,nat,integer,real]

  returns a set of subsets proving A is a subset of D
  K = [A,B,C,D] 
  A sub B sub C sub D
  we could reduce K with is_subset to true
  
  goal: have a safe execute chain command
  exe_chain(argx, [f,g,h])
  where is_subset( f(cod), g(dom)), etc to show 
  h o g o f(arg) is a safe composition of functions 
  before we run them.
